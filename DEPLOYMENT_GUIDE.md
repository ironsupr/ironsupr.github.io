# GitHub Deployment Configuration

## No Secrets Required

This portfolio no longer requires any API keys or secrets for deployment. The site is fully static and does not depend on external APIs.

## Deployment Process

The portfolio automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch:

1. GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically
2. Sets production environment variables
3. Builds and deploys to GitHub Pages

## Verification

After pushing code:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Check the latest workflow run
3. Look for "âœ… Production environment configured" in the logs
4. Verify the site is live at your GitHub Pages URL

## What Was Removed

- Gemini AI API integration
- Project idea generation feature
- All API key requirements

The portfolio now focuses on showcasing your existing projects and skills without requiring external API dependencies.
